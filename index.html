							<h2 class="minor">Background</h2>
							<p><p>Instacart is an online gorcery ordering and pickup service that is looking to unccover more information on their sales data and customer puchasing behaviors.</p>
							<h2 class="minor">Key Questions</h2>
							<p><p>1. What customer profiles make up the majority of sales?
								  <br>2. Which products are the more popular?
								  <br>3. What hours are the most/least popular?
								  <br>4. Which products are in large supply?
							</p>
							<h2 class="minor">Goal</h2>
							<p><p>Use the given data sets to provide data-driven insights on customer profiles and spending behavior to help improve Instacart's marketing strategies.</p>
							<p><p>_____________________________________________________________________</p>
							<h2 class="minor">Data Understanding and Preparation</h2>
							<p><p>To get a good understanding of the data, I imported necessary libraries and datasets into a Jupyter Notebook. Used data wrangling and cleaning techniques to make sure the data was acceaptable to use for analysis.

								<br> Merged all necessary data, created new variables and exclusion flags. Used comments within the code to make it accessible to others reading my analysis.

							<h2 class="minor">Data Analysis</h2>
							</p><br><span class="image fit"><img src="images/instacart orders 1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Instacart should consider a marketing campaign around Personal Care, Household, and Pantry items as they are in large supply, but not many orders. <p ></p>
								
							</p><br><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Instacart orders 2.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Determine when orders are being placed. We can see that the bulk of the orders are happening on Saturday (0) and Sunday (1), and the most popular shopping hours are from 9am - 4pm. 
							
								<br>   </p>
							<br><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Instacart weekday.png" alt="" /></span>
						<br> Instacart has many family profiles that use their service, but he largest customer base are those that are married with children.
						<br> 
						</p><br><span class="image fit"><img src="images/instacart profile.png" alt="" /></span>
						
							
								<h2 class="minor">Recommendations</h2>
								
							<p>
							<br>  1. Target customers that are married with children as they occupy the largest family profile group.
							<br>  2. For the marketing campaign, use popular products such as beverages, dairy, and produce. Also consider personal care and household items because of the high supply. 
							<br>  3. Schedule advertisements during the weekdays and outside of the hours of 9am - 4pm as these are the periods with the fewest orders. 
							<br>   
							<br> 
							
							<h2 class="minor">Next Steps</h2>
							<p><p>Closely monitor sales after running appropriate advertisements to the targeted profile group and for the suggested products. Get additional feedback from family groups to see if the advertisements are impacting buying decisions.

							<p><p>The Brazilian E-Commerce company, Olist, is an online company that brings together individual sellers and buyers from all over Brazil in one, easy-to-use, place.</p>
							<h2 class="minor">Key Questions</h2>
							<p><p>1. Are there any common factors that influence a review score?
								  <br>2. Where are most of the orders coming from in Brazil?
								  <br>3. What product categories are the most popular?
								  <br>4. What categories would be beneficial for new sellers to break in to?
							</p>
							<h2 class="minor">Goal</h2>
							<p><p>The goal of the analysis is to gather insights about Olist to see how the company can improve in a way that increases revenue and makes the customers happy.</p>
							<p><p>_____________________________________________________________________</p>
							<h2 class="minor">Data Understanding and Preparation</h2>
							<p><p>Imported all of the necessary libraries and datasets into a Jupyter Notebook. I was able to use common variables to merge the data into one useful dataset. From there I could apply cleaning methods, exploration, and descriptive statistics.
								<br>Missing values, duplicates, inconsistant data types, unnecessary columns.

							<h2 class="minor">Data Analysis</h2>
							<p><p>Consider correlations, time series analysis, linear regressions throughout analysis with Python. Use Brazil States .json file to make a Chlorpleth map to gain a better understanding of the E-Commerce layout. 
								</p><br><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2024-03-13 at 10.31.12 PM.png" alt="" /></span>
								<br> Import data into Tableau to explore other variable relationships. Determine the reasons for poor review score as well as good review scores. 
								<br> What items are selling the best and where are people purchasing these items?
							</p><br><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2024-03-13 at 9.59.02 PM.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>From this graph we can see a drop in average review score during the time period of December 2017 - March 2018. 
								<br> Comparing to the graph below, the top 10 products had a large spike in total revenue, as well as slower shipping times during the same time period.  </p>
							<br><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2024-03-13 at 9.58.54 PM.png" alt="" /></span>
						<br> Each order has an estimated deliever date. An order that is considered 'delayed' would be an order that arrived after the estimated date. 
						<br> There is a clear difference between orders that arrive on time and orders that are delayed for their review scores. 
						</p><br><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2024-03-13 at 9.59.28 PM.png" alt="" /></span>
						
							
								<h2 class="minor">Recommendations</h2>
								Orders that are arriving 'on-time' are recieving a review score that is 63% higher than the review score of an order that was delayed. 
							<p>
							<br>  1. Focus on the high revenue products such as the 'health and beauty' and 'bed, bath, and table' categories. 
							<br>  2. Expand further north by adding additional sellers in those areas.
							<br>  3. Determine what causes orders to be delayed to prevent it from happening again in the future. 
							<br>  4. New sellers would benefit from a high demand and low supply of sellers in areas such as 'wathes and gifts' and 'bed, bath, and table'.

								<h2 class="minor">Background</h2>
								<p><p>During the Influenza season, hospitals become overcrowded with patients which leads to an increase in deaths. Staffing agencies need to determine where to send additional staff to lower the death rates.</p>
								<h2 class="minor">Key Questions</h2>
								<p><p>1. What states are in need for the additional staff?

								<p><p> The vulnerable population is defined as indivuduals that are 65 years or older.

							<article id="highlights">
								<h2 class="major">Career highlights</h2>
								<p>As an educator with 10 years experience of taking complex ideas and presenting them in a simple and concise way, I have found a new joy in analytics. I incorporate my problem solving and technical skills of Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau during my current role as much as possible.  
								

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cfdatacert.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I have learned a lot from my experience in the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Course. With a combination of my drive and problem solvings skills, as well as the techniques I have practiced in this course, I believe I would instantly become an asset to a team that is looking to succeed. </p>
					
								
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Data Certificate.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
								
								
								<p>    </p>    
								<p>    </p> <h2 class="minor">Problem solving</h2>
								As a teacher, there are many additional responsibilities that go on at school. Our students would vote for various things throughout the year and the Administration would always have to sort and count the votes by hand. In a small school, this wouldn't be a big deal, but in our school with over 1,200 students, this could take a while. 
								I went to the Administration to see why they didn't want to do something like an online form. They expressed valid concerns of students voting twice, students giving out the link so they could recieve extra votes from family or friends from other schools, and also students voting outside of their grade level. 
								<p></p>I considered their concerns and knew I could solve all of those issues with SQL. I first set up a Microsoft Form for students to vote for Homecoming. We sent it out to all of the students telling them to just vote within your grade level and only vote one time. When the voting was over, we could initially see the votes within the Microsoft Form page, but I knew this data could be inaccurate. 
								<p></p>I downloaded the results as a .csv file and create a table in PostgreSQL to input the values. I joined the raw results with our student_accounts data ON the student email address. This would null any vote that was not from a student from our school. Then, I grouped distinct results by grade level and I was able to see the number of votes for each grade level for each participant.
								I quickly sent the results to Administration and they were able to communicate the results to the students in minutes with confidence and without mistakes.
								I saved Administration hours of time and now we use the queries for every vote we have in the school. 
							<p></p>
								
					
								<h2 class="minor">Communication</h2>
								<p> 
								</p>Constant communication with students, coworkers, and parents to increase awareness of students' abilities and understanding of grades. Consistent communication with all individuals involved leads to better understanting of expectations.  
									
								<p><p>
									<h2 class="minor">Technical</h2>
									<p>Cleaned, filtered, and sorted SAT score data for entire school. Assigned students to groups according to teacher and score for each topic. This allowed for individualized instruction for each student. 
									<p></p>Utilized excel for attendance, grades, and master schedule of students. Used conditional formatting and created formulas to reduce class sizes and prevent overlap of students.  
										<p>
										<h2 class="minor">Results</h2>
									<p>Increased class average by 38% on the SAT by identifying strengths and weaknesses through data driven teaching.
									<p>My technical, as well as my problem solving skills, allowed for us to identify strenths and weaknesses of various groups to specifically target their individual needs. This process had a direct impact on SAT scores. </p>
							
							<p></p>
							<h2 class="minor">previous employers remarks</h2>
								<p>"Andrew does a great job in the classroom varying his teaching strategies and differentiating instruction. He incorporates technology and interesting activities, while focusing on math skills. His students respect him and are engaged in the learning process." - Dr. Branch, Principal.
